# Tool-Classification
 
Here you can find the code I used to research a tool classification model using 2 different approaches, Early Fusion and Late Fusion.

The code is divided into 2 folders, each containing the code for each approach.
Inside each of the repositories you can find the model, training script and Trainer class, as well as the data loader and the Datasets.

Many assumptions were made in the code, due to the dynamic nature of the data and the time constraints of the project.
Thus, the code is not intended to be used as is, but rather as a reference for the model and the training process.

For a deeper explanation of the task, see the [paper](https://github.com/NaorHaba/MyDigitalNurse/blob/main/tool_classification/Project%20Report%20-%20Tool%20Classification.pdf) I have written about it.
