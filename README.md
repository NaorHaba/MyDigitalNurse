# MyDigitalNurse
 
This repository contains the code for the project "MyDigitalNurse" - a research project under the _SCALPEL_ laboratory in the Technion.
The repository includes 2 repositories, one for each of the tasks in the project:
* [tool_classification]() - a repository for the tool classification task. Given videos of a surgical procedure from 2 different camera views, 
the task is to classify the tools used in the procedure by the surgeon and the assistant. This part of the project is done by Naor Haba.
For a deeper explanation of the task, see the README.md file in the repository.
* [GCN]() - a repository for the graph convolutional network task. Given the used tools in many surgeries, the task is to learn a knowledge base
according to the surgeries labels and accordingly, predict the labels of new surgeries. This part of the project is done by Lior Yariv.
For a deeper explanation of the task, see the README.md file in the repository.
